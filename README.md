# Band-Gap-Reference
A temperature-independent stable voltage source (BGR) designed in Cadence 

BGR consists of two parts: PTAT & CTAT

The key idea of Band Gap Reference is to combine two voltages with opposite temperature coefficients, so that they cancel each other out & we get a moderately stable voltage.
